Steps:

Authors *_* Books
-> ManyToMany relationship
Authors
- firstN
- lastN
- id
- Books

Books
- title
- isbn
- Authors
- id

- Gen the project
- Create pojo ->then to -> entities
- Now on to relationships => POJO -> Entity and id generation stra -> Hibernate -> Then relationship
- Authors manyToMany on Set<Books> with mappedBy = authors -> in books pojo
- AND, in books pojo, JOINTABLE!!           # This was taken from his source
    - Join table is configuraed as we need to maintian the relationship
- Now, impl the hashCode and equals methods -> for jpa, and as well impl the toString()

- Now, Repository -> Spring dataJpa
    - create interface - impl crudRepo
    - Spring is going to provide the impl for the repo class.

- Now, commandLine runner
    - myClass will implement the commandLineRunner
    - And @Component -> Tell spring it is a spring managed component
    - AuthorRepo, and BookRepo are IN CONSTRUCTOR??? -> SPring will inject the beans ITSELF, even without autoWired
    - Did a add on the author and book, and then did a repo.count() to get count of data from h2

- Assign - Add publisher
    - Nothing fancy, just add a pojo - entity it - and save to repo with a runner

- Now, to add relationship to publisher
    - Book *_* Author   (Many to many)
    - Book *_ Publisher (Many to one)
    - Marked publisher set<Book> with OneToMany
    - Book publisher - manyToOne
    - Also, added hint in publisher <Set<Book>> joinCOlumn??
        - Maybe - jpa hint - on books row - we need to maintain a publisher id column
    - ISSUE - Save transient state of book
        - single publisher save to repo wiht books set in its pojo, and in book, the same publisher added
        - Issue was publisher as a child, it needed to be added to the db first, the a ref of it can be assigned to the book row.
        - So create a publisher no books set, add to the db - done.
        - Then set books, assig the ref od publisher to books
        - Then repo save on book, then publisher.

- H2 console
    - By def, it wont show in chrome
    - 8080 - spring.h2.console.enabled=true in app.props
    - http://localhost:8080/h2-console
    - connection url is - jdbc:h2:mem:testdb - user sa - pwd - <blank>
